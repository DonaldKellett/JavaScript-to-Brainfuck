A collection of convoluted Brainfuck programs that translate to very simple JavaScript code.  These show that even seemingly trivial tasks in high-level programming languages can be very difficult to program in low-level programming languages.  MIT License

## Guarantee of Correctness of Programs

Ideally, each program in this Repo should be tested against a comprehensive set of test cases (using TDD through other high-level programming languages and a suitable interpreter) to demostrate that they indeed behave as expected.  All such test cases (if present) should be included in each individual folder containing the related program.
